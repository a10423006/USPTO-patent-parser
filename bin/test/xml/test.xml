        <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a guide element for an agricultural soil-cultivation machine comprising a connection region for arranging the guide element on a share tip, and comprising a first screw connection for attaching the guide element on a holder, in particular, on a tine of the soil-cultivation machine.</p>
        <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention further relates to a tool combination with a guide element and a share tip for an agricultural soil-cultivation machine, having a connection region of the guide element for arranging the guide element on a share tip, and having a first screw connection for attaching the guide element on a holder, in particular, on a tine of the soil-cultivation machine, wherein a thickness of the guide element in the connection region corresponds to a thickness of the share tip at its end, facing the guide element, within predefined tolerances.</p>
        <heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
        <p id="p-0005" num="0004">DE 3628910 A1 discloses a tool combination, having a blade tip and a guide plate, which can be mounted together on a blade of a tine of a soil-cultivation machine. The share tip and the guide plate are connected together by a form-fitting connection, so that only one fastening screw is required for attaching the guide plate and the share tip to the blade. The form-fitting connection is formed by a tappet on the share tip, which engages with a corresponding recess in the guide plate. At its free end, the guide plate is bent around the blade to safely deflect the flow of soil from the blade at the upper free end of the guide plate and push it away in the intended direction. The bending achieves a form-fitting connection between the guide plate and the blade so that the guide plate can be attached to the blade with only one fastening screw.</p>
        <p id="p-0006" num="0005">A disadvantage of the disclosed tool combination is that the share tip, which is exposed to much heavier load than the guide plate during use, wears faster than the guide plate and, accordingly, must be replaced sooner. Due to the exposed form-fitting connection, deformations can be introduced in the area between the guide plate and the share tip during operation, preventing, or at least impeding, removal of the share tip from the guide element. This results in increased maintenance effort, during which a guide element that is not worn may have to be replaced. A further disadvantage arises from the fact that the guide element is more heavily stressed in its connection region to the share tip than at its free end. Replacement of the guide element is thus determined by its wear in the connection region, while the free end is still intact. The same applies to the share tip, which wears significantly faster at its front cutting edge than at its end facing the guide element. The tool combination shown, therefore, results in uneven wear behaviour of the components used with respect to each other and within the components. As a result, the most heavily stressed components or component portions determine the service life of the tool combination, and, thus, the maintenance intervals. During the required replacement, generally intact components or component portions must be replaced as well.</p>
        <p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 10 2011 102 053 A1 discloses a tool combination having a share tip, which can be mounted on a tine of a soil-cultivation machine. The share tip is formed from a carrier part, the cutting end of which is equipped with a cutting element made of hard metal. On the side of the cutting element, secondary cutters are soldered to the carrier part at an angle. Adjacent to the carrier part, a guide plate is provided, which encloses the tine partially at its free end. A guide part is provided, which covers the carrier part with the exception of the cutting elements and secondary cutters. The guide part is connected to the guide plate in a form-fitting manner and is detachably connected to the carrier part. The multi-part construction makes it possible to replace only the functional components that are worn. The present document assumes that it is extremely unlikely that all functional components will become worn at the same time and, therefore, they must be replaced separately. This also applies to an embodiment of the present invention in which the guide plate and the guide part are designed as a single component. Here, the document provides a symmetrically constructed, and thus rotatable, guide plate so that the end facing the carrier part can be rotated when worn and continued to be used.</p>
        <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, too, there is the disadvantage that, due to the exposed form-fitting connection, deformations may be introduced in the region between the guide plate and the carrier part or the guide part, preventing, or at least impeding, separation of the components. This results in increased maintenance effort, during which components that are not worn may have to be replaced. Due to the different service life of the various functional components, frequent maintenance with associated downtimes of the soil-cultivation machine are required.</p>
        <heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
        <p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a guide element of the aforementioned kind and a tool combination having such a guide element, resulting in reduced maintenance effort.</p>
        <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the present invention with regard to the share tip is solved by the fact that the guide element has varying thickness, at least in regions along the longitudinal extension thereof running from the connection region to a turned-away end region. The thickness of the guide element in the various regions of the guide element can thus be adapted to the stress occurring there, and hence to the wear occurring there. Areas that are exposed to high stress are formed thicker than regions with lower stress. This ensures that the guide element has a comparable service life in all regions. With these measures, maintenance intervals can be extended, when compared to guide elements with consistent thickness, and comparable maintenance intervals can be achieved with reduced use of material. Furthermore, the change intervals of the guide element can be adapted to the change intervals of a connected share tip, significantly reducing the total required maintenance effort. A reduced use of materials advantageously results in reduced manufacturing costs and a reduction in weight of the guide element. In particular, if a plurality of guide elements is attached to the soil-cultivation machine, the weight reduction results in a reduction of the total stress on the soil-cultivation machine as well as of the fuel consumption of a drive unit of the soil-cultivation machine. The guide element may be manufactured, for example, as a forged part and thus be designed to be very strong and resistant to abrasion.</p>
        <p id="p-0011" num="0010">The mechanical stress of the guide element is greatest adjacent to the share tip. Therefore, it can be provided that the guide element has its greatest thickness in the connection region facing the share tip.</p>
        <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The mechanical stress, and thus the abrasion, of the guide element are lowest in its end region facing away from the share tip. In order to achieve a comparable service life between the connection region and the end region of the guide element, it can therefore be provided that the thickness of the guide element is smallest in its end region facing away from the share tip.</p>
        <p id="p-0013" num="0012">A comparable service life over the entire length of the guide element can be achieved by the thickness of the guide element decreasing continuously from the connection region to the end region.</p>
        <p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, it can be provided that the thickness of the guide element in its connection region corresponds to the thickness of the share tip associated with the guide element at its end facing the guide element within predetermined tolerances. For the passing soil, this results in a continuous transition without pronounced steps where increased wear occurs. Furthermore, the same thickness of the guide element and of the share tip in their adjoining regions results in comparable service lives of the two components in these regions. If the remaining regions of the share tip and the guide element are adapted by means of corresponding thickness variations or, for example, by local coating with hard material elements, so that they have a service life comparable to the adjacent regions, the share tip and the guide element, as well as the components within themselves in the various regions, will have a comparable service life, and thus comparable maintenance intervals. The components can thus be replaced as the same time, resulting in reduced maintenance effort and reduced downtime of the soil-cultivation machine.</p>
        <p id="p-0015" num="0014">The guide element is mounted to the carrier with a first screw connection. A secure and wear-resistant first screw connection can be achieved by the first screw connection being arranged in the connection region of the guide element and/or by a first screw head of a first fastening screw of the first screw connection being arranged in a countersunk position relative to a deflecting surface of the guide element. Fastening of the guide element is thus done in the area of its greatest material thickness, resulting in a resilient connection between the guide element and the carrier. Due to the recessed screw head, it is protected from passing soil and thus from abrasive wear. The wear protection is further improved by the fact that soil sticks above the screw head in the screw receptacle and thus shields the screw head from the passing soil. Due to the present high material strength, the screw receptacle can be designed correspondingly deep. The screw head is therefore countersunk with respect to the deflection surface of the guide element, and thus protected against wear, even after severe abrasion of the guide element has taken place. The guide element is thus securely held on the carrier until replacement is required.</p>
        <p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, it can be provided that the guide element can be constructed for its back side to be in contact with the carrier and/or that the guide element has protruding bridges on its back side, arranged spaced from each other, and/or that a guide receptacle for the carrier is formed between the bridges. By a rear contact of the guide element with the carrier, high resilience against deformation is achieved even in areas of reduced thickness of the guide element since forces applied to the guide element against a tool feed direction are transferred to the carrier. The lateral bridges allow for simple mounting of the guide element, since the guide element can be easily aligned with respect to the carrier due to the bridges and the guide receptacle. A further advantage of the bridges results from the fact that they absorb lateral loads on the guide plate during operation. The guide element is thus affixed on the carrier in a form-fitting manner, transversely to the tool feed direction.</p>
        <p id="p-0017" num="0016">The bridges can be advantageously arranged in the connection region and/or in the end region of the guide element. In these regions, the bridges accomplish the best possible lateral guiding of the guide element. Compared to longer bridges, for example, ones that are continuous from the connection region to the end region, there is an advantage in material optimization and, as a result, a correspondingly lower weight of the guide element with the same attainable level of lateral guiding.</p>
        <p id="p-0018" num="0017">Transverse forces acting on the guide element can be especially well absorbed due to the two bridges being arranged opposite of one another on both sides of the carrier and/or the bridges having drafts on their sides facing the carrier, such that their mutual distance increases with increasing distance from the back side of the guide element. The drafts facilitate mounting of the guide element to the carrier since the guide element aligns itself to the carrier. Due to the drafts, a guide receptacle is achieved that is widening outwards and into which the carrier can be easily inserted. The widening guide receptacle allows manufacturing the guide element by forging.</p>
        <p id="p-0019" num="0018">A rear support of the guide element in the region of the bridges may be achieved by the fact that a contact surface for contact of the guide element with the carrier is formed between the bridges and/or that clearances in the form of grooves are provided in the transition from the drafts to the contact surface. The clearances accommodate the edges of the carrier. This achieves a large area of contact of the contact surface of the guide element on the carrier even if the same has a manufacturing-related burr, for example, at the edges.</p>
        <p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one embodiment of the present invention, it can be provided that the bridges have outer bridge surfaces on their side facing away from the guide element and that the transitions from the drafts to the outer bridge surfaces are rounded. The rounded transitions from the drafts to the outer bridge surfaces prevent tilting of the guide element with respect to the carrier during assembly. Due to the rounded transitions and the adjacent drafts, the guide element can be aligned simply on the carrier and can self-align. In addition, the rounded transitions result in a stress-optimized construction in which stress spikes, as occur in the area of sharp edges under mechanical load, can be avoided.</p>
        <p id="p-0021" num="0020">The guide element and an associated share tip can be aligned with each other, by the guide element having an attachment, in particular, a plug attachment, in the connection region for affixing it in a receptacle of the share tip.</p>
        <p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, it may be provided in this case that the shape of the attachment of the guide element is designed such that it can be connected only with a share tip that is uniquely associated to it by a receptacle that is adapted to it in its shape. This achieves an encoding in the assignment of a guide element to a share tip, resulting in only an associated type of guide element being connectable to a certain design of a share tip. As a result of this measure, only those share tips and guide elements can be connected together that are matched to one another, for example, in their wear behaviour. For example, share tip types with different thickness may be provided where a type of guide element with matched thickness in the connection region is uniquely associated.</p>
        <p id="p-0023" num="0022">Such an encoding between the guide element and the share tip can be effected by the attachment of the leading element being equipped with at least one projection and/or at least one recess for cooperating with a receptacle and/or an attachment molded on the share tip.</p>
        <p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition to the first screw connection, effective affixing on the guide element can be achieved by the attachment and the receptacle forming a form-fitting connection. The guide element with its attachment is thus held in the receptacle of the share tip in a form-fitting manner.</p>
        <p id="p-0025" num="0024">A possible embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that the guide element

            <b>40</b>. This allows the crop flow to be directed to the side of the cultivator. In particular, this continuously targeted deflection may reduce the tractive force requirements. Here, not only the front, but, in particular, the entire guide element may be twisted or coiled. This reduces the parts cost. Preferably the guide element should be coiled in the range between 50&#xb0; and 80&#xb0;. Optimum deflection is achieved in the range between 15&#xb0; and 70&#xb0;.
                                                        
            
        
        </p>
        <p id="p-0027" num="0026">The object of the present invention with regard to the tool combination is solved by the fact that the guide element has varying thickness, at least in regions along the longitudinal extension thereof running from the connection region to a turned-away end region. Due to the varying thickness, the resilience of the different regions of the guide element can be adapted to the respective loads present during use of the tool so that at least approximately equal service life is achieved over the entire longitudinal extension of the guide element. The guide element does therefore not have to be replaced prematurely because a particularly heavily stressed region is worn out prematurely. Due to the thickness of the guide element being locally adapted to its load, its service life can be adapted to the connected share tip so that the same replacement intervals are advantageously achieved for the guide element and the share tip.</p>
        <p id="p-0028" num="0027">An adjustment of the thickness of the guide element to the stress actually present during use of the tool can be achieved by the thickness of the guide element decreasing from the connection region toward an end region of the guide element, opposite the connection region.</p>
        <p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, it can be provided that the share tip has a receptacle, which is covered by a covering portion in the tool feed direction (V), that the guide element has an attachment, in particular a plug attachment, and that a connection, in particular a form-fitting connection, formed by a receptacle and an attachment engaging therewith, is effective in the region of the receptacle between the share tip and the guide element. Due to the form-fitting connection, the guide element is securely attached to the share tip and aligned with respect to the same. The covering portion prevents the region of the form-fitting connection from being directly exposed to the passing soil. The form-fitting connection is thus protected against abrasive wear. Furthermore, the attachment is held by the covering portion, so that it will not buckle under load. This achieves a much longer service life of the form-fitting connection compared to a form-fitting connection that is open in the tool feed direction. Due to the reduced wear of the attachment and the receptacle, the share tip and the guide element can be easily and reliably separated from each other even after high mechanical stress, keeping the maintenance effort when changing the guide element and/or the share tip low.</p>
        <p id="p-0030" num="0029">Unique assignment of a share tip to a guide element matched to it in terms of its wear can be achieved by selecting the shape of the attachment, in particular the plug attachment, depending on the thickness of the guide element in its end region, and the shape of the receptacle of the share tip depending on the thickness of the share tip at its end facing the guide element end, such that the attachment, in particular the plug attachment, and the receptacle are connectable only with identical thickness of the guide element in its connection region and of the share tip at its end facing the guide element. Due to the design of the receptacle and the attachment, only guide elements and share tips with identical thickness in their transition region will match each other. Due to this encoding, it can be ensured that only those guide elements can be assigned to the respective share tips for which the service life is accordingly matched to the service life of the share tips.</p>
        <p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, it can be provided that the guide element along its longitudinal extension, preferably in its end region, or otherwise at any point on the front side

A uniform passage of the soil from the share tip to the guide element is achieved without creating any areas of increased resistance, and thus abrasion.

            <b>1</b> may be designed at least partially concave, convex, or corrugated. A concave geometry forms a channel in the longitudinal direction of the guide element for directional guiding of the material. With a convex design, the material is deflected to either side of the cultivator. This creates compression and expansion zones in the longitudinal direction of the guide element in favor of an improved wear behaviour. Here, corrugation can already offer a significant advantage. Instead of a concave or convex contour, attached surface geometries may be provided as well. A varying width of the guide element may be provided in the width direction as well in order to influence the conveying effect in a targeted manner.

        <?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
        <p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to turf treatment, more particularly to treatment of sports playing surfaces such as football, rugby and hockey pitches, and tennis courts which, during the course of a playing season, are subject to wear and tear and also suffer from a build-up of thatch, which is an accumulation of layers of partially decomposed leaves, stems and roots. Diseases and other blights including algae, moss, fungi, and slime mould can invade the turf, and may be made worse by the presence of thatch.</p>
        <p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is usually recommended that thatch be treated by mechanical thatching equipment, an operation usually referred to as scarification, but sometimes known as verticutting, although that term is also used for the process of cutting vertically into the turf using fine blades, sometimes known as turf grooming. It is recommended to carry out scarification in several treatments rather than attempting to remove all the thatch at once, but this is essentially because convent scarifiers remove thatch in thin furrows, leaving &#x2018;ridges&#x2019; of thatch between them, and so cannot remove all the thatch in one pass.</p>
        <p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 6,094,860 discloses the use of artificial fibre reinforcement for grass turf areas in playing fields subject to heavy wear, and other patents and proprietary systems similarly involve the use of artificial fibre reinforcement.</p>
        <p id="p-0005" num="0004">&#x201c;Desso&#xae; Grassmaster&#x201d; is a turf reinforcement system in which artificial grass fibres are injected some 20 cm deep into a grass surface, projecting some 25 mm above the soil. The maintenance of this system, as regards mowing, verticutting and ventilating, is said to be no different from the maintenance of ordinary turf. Mowing, of course, must be carried out with the cutter height at or above the height of the artificial grass fibres, e.g. at 26 mm or more if the fibre height is 25 mm, otherwise they would be cut or pulled out.</p>
        <p id="p-0006" num="0005">The artificial grass fibres are injected into a matrix of sand, which of course has no nutritional value, and there is only a thin top layer of humus, if indeed any, so the natural grass needs to be treated with fertiliser more than it would if grown in deep soil. This exacerbates problems of disease and infestation, bearing in mind that about 97% of the turf is natural grass. The sand also, over the course of a playing season, compacts more than does the usual substrate of natural, unreinforced turf.</p>
        <p id="p-0007" num="0006">On this, or indeed any, turf, moreover, undesired grasses and weeds such as clover can be a problem. Clover is especially problematic on playing surfaces such as tennis courts, as it tends to be slippery. Weeds are usually treated with systemic herbicides, which take time to act and which may require several treatments over a space of weeks.</p>
        <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides an improved method and apparatus for treating turf, including artificial grass-reinforced turf planted in a matrix of sand and/or soil.</p>
        <p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention comprises a method for the treatment of turf comprising grass growing in a matrix comprising removing matrix including any thatch and other infestation by blading moving through the matrix to a predetermined depth d.</p>
        <p id="p-0010" num="0009">The depth d may be determined by sampling the matrix to establish the depth to which it needs to be removed. It may, of course, be estimated on the basis of a greenkeeper's knowledge and experience. If the matrix is badly infected it may be removed to such a depth that all the grass growing in it is removed, so that fresh sand or other matrix material may be applied and the area reseeded. However, it may be sufficient, if the infection has not penetrated too deeply, to remove thatch and matrix down to a depth above that at which grass roots are found which may then regenerate without the need to reseed.</p>
        <p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some methods for reinforcing turf, artificial grass fibres are attached to a backing buried beneath the surface. U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,317 discloses a permanent backing; U.S. Pat. No. 6,094,860 discloses a biodegradable backing that may, however, remain in situ for two years or more. It will, of course, be important with such systems to ensure that the depth d is less than the depth at which the backing would be disturbed.</p>
        <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The thatch, grass and matrix may be lifted by a rotor rotated about a horizontal axis with teeth that may be extended below surface level. The blading may be angled with respect to the rotor axis so that there is no or substantially no part of the length of the rotor that does not have blading at some part of its circumference, and the rotor is rotated at such speed, relative to the rate of traverse over the turf, that no or substantially no part of the turf is left untreated. The blading, and particularly the teeth, may be of some substantial thickness, e.g. 5-10 mm. The rotor may be rotated so that the blading moves forwardly through the matrix. The blading may be in the form of hooked teeth, with the hooks facing in the direction of travel.</p>
        <p id="p-0013" num="0012">Treatment by such a rotor, whilst it may appear drastic, leaves the matrix level and raked and in a state where it can be instantly re-seeded, possibly with the addition of fresh sand and/or soil.</p>
        <p id="p-0014" num="0013">While it may be surprising that such a rotor can be used to such effect on natural turf, it is even more surprising that it can be done on Desso Grassmaster&#xae; and other reinforced turf systems without adversely affecting the artificial grass fibres.</p>
        <p id="p-0015" num="0014">Even the regular substrate of natural turf can, after heavy use, such as a tennis court after a tournament, can become compacted. The blading may be made robust enough to cut through such compacted substrate. Compacted sand, of course, will need such robustness and will have a more abrasive effect. The binding may be made wear-resistant as by being tipped with tungsten carbide or another carbide or other wear-resistant material. Blading so tipped can survive treating an area the size of a football pitch in one or even two passes without noticeable wear, so that the treatment is essentially uniform throughout without the need to change or dress blading during the treatment.</p>
        <p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention also comprises equipment adapted for the treatment of turf reinforced with artificial grass fibres in a sand or other matrix by removing matrix to a depth d below the matrix level, comprising a horizontal rotor having blading having peripherally distributed teeth at least of length d, and drive means to traverse and rotate the rotor over the turf, characterised by blade height control means adapted to deploy the teeth up to a depth d below the matrix level.</p>
        <p id="p-0017" num="0016">The blades may exhibit a saw tooth profile. The teeth may be inclined to the direction of motion, and so dimensioned that there is no, or substantially no, part of the length of the rotor that does not have a tooth at some part of its circumference. The teeth may be sufficiently narrow, however, that the anchored artificial turf is simply deflected by passage of the teeth, and then springs back, without being removed or damaged. The blades may have tips reinforced against wear with, for example, tungsten or other carbide, and may be hooked.</p>
        <p id="p-0018" num="0017">A typical thickness for the blade is 10 mm, but thicknesses of between 5 and 15 mm will be found satisfactory. The teeth may be the same thickness as the binding and may be fashioned as if from a solid blade by removal of U-shaped portions and then twisting the tooth formations left thereby so that the leading edge of the blade is parallel to the rotor axis when mounted thereon, which means it will be square to the direction of its motion through the ground.</p>
        <p id="p-0019" num="0018">A rotor having a diameter of, say, 500 mm, with helical blading, may have twenty-four teeth on one complete turn of the helix, and may have four helices. A typical rotational speed for such a rotor would be 1000 rpm. Driving the rotor so that the blades move forward through the turf, the blade linear speed through the turf is about 25 metres per second plus, of course, the forward speed of the tractor, which, however, will be only of the order of one metre per second. As the blade advances one metre through the turf, the rotor will rotate some seventeen times, so one metre length of turf of blade width will be subject to the attentions effectively of four times seventeen teeth, or sixty eight teeth, or a blade will dig into the turf every three millimetres, effectively removing all the material intended to be removed.</p>
        <p id="p-0020" num="0019">A rotor such as this can remove all material to the desired depth in a single pass, or at most two passes.</p>
        <p id="p-0021" num="0020">The helical blade arrangement will push removed material to one side. A helical blade, rotated so that its ground engaging teeth move forward in the direction of tractor travel, will push the material to the driver's right or left, depending on the &#x2018;hand&#x2019; of the helix. A conveyor can be mounted adjacent the end of the rotor towards which the material is pushed to accept the material and elevate it into a companion trailer, drawn by another tractor keeping station with the rotor.</p>
        <p id="p-0022" num="0021">An auger-type grass mower is known from EP0974225, which has a similar arrangement of blade for free cutting of grass, which is to say, cutting using the blades as knives, as opposed to cutting against a fixed blade, scissor-fashion. For this purpose the blade is set to the desired height of cut and, if used on turf containing reinforcing artificial grass fibre, would be set to cut just above the height of the artificial grass fibres. The blades also have to rotate quickly, in order to cut the grass, rather than just bend it out of the way. The teeth of that mower are set to the side by bending the blades by approximately the thickness of the metal from which they are made, and the three front edges of the teeth act as cutting edges. They are said to have advantages over another free cutting blade arrangement in EP0328080 in that they further reduce the size of the clippings. By contrast, the teeth of the equipment of the present invention are not configured to cut grass, whether artificial or natural, but to lift thatch, matrix and natural grass from the turf, leaving artificial grass, if present, in situ.</p>
        <p id="p-0023" num="0022">The rotor may have double, triple or more helix binding. As in EP0974255, the blade may be made in segments for ease of construction and repair. Four segments can make up a complete turn of the helix</p>
        <p id="p-0024" num="0023">A rotor may be made adaptable to different conditions by blading being readily removable and replaceable, so that it can have different densities of teeth. If so, then it would be desirable to have an even number of helices, say four, so that two could be removed, leaving two, so as not to unbalance the rotor.</p>
        <p id="p-0025" num="0024">The rotor may be mounted on a chassis adapted for mounting on or towing behind a tractor unit especially one of the kind used for turf treatment and comprising an arrangement rotating the rotor. The chassis or tractor unit may carry blade height setting means, as well as a transmission to drive the rotor in rotation. The rotor may be associated with a collector for material lifted by the blading.</p>

However, when the matrix is badly infected with algae, all the natural grass may be removed by driving the blading sufficiently deep, and new matrix laid down and reseeded. So long as, when treating reinforced turf, the depth d is less than the depth of any backing such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,317 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,094,860, and, in particular with the Desso Grassmaster&#xae; system, which does not have a backing, the depth to which the artificial fibres are injected, any artificial grass will remain in place.</p>
